[5:34 pm, 14/03/2025] Haaziq: Important Notes:

DO NOT use any backend (like Node.js, Python, PHP, or databases).
The entire project should be a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript static website.
The fireworks should look vibrant and exciting.
The music should loop in the background.
The website should be responsive for mobile and desktop.

Visual & Animation Enhancements

1️⃣ Smooth Text Transitions – Use CSS animations for text fades and entrance effects. Example:

2️⃣ Fireworks Effect – Instead of basic fireworks, use JavaScript canvas to create colorful, randomized bursts that feel natural. Try the fireworks.js library or code your own using the HTML5 canvas API.

3️⃣ Glowing Stars in the Background – Add a subtle starry effect (small twinkling dots) to make the scene feel more magical.

Upload a photo of your brother (or a childhood picture) and display it in a cool animated frame.
Add a hover effect to reveal a special message when the mouse moves over the image.
